# Sandbox RP
This is a heavily modified version of **Mythic Framework** for Sandbox RP. This is a custom framework that uses a component system, all UI's are built in React. This codebase is being released with the full permissions of the original Mythic Framework authors **Alzar & Dr Nick**

# Notice
This version of Sandbox removes the need for WebSockets but removes the Sandbox dispatch system. I would recommend just using [Mythic](https://github.com/Mythic-Framework/mythic-framework) as a base since everyone is converting Sandbox scripts to Mythic.
Although I am banned from the Mythic Discord server, I would still like to support the community in any way I can, so if there are any issues, please open an issue on GitHub, and I'll reply when I can.

## Information

# ðŸš§DISCLAIMERðŸš§
We do not own this framework, and we am simply trying to give it the support it deserves. The framework was originally built by Alzar & Dr Nick. Alzar has taken the liberty of releasing the framework, which you can find by following the [original repository](https://github.com/BadCodesGG/sandbox-fivem)
